# Local Web Server

Version: V0.2

Project that will be hopefully used for control of the Pi away from the Terminal

At the moment, this will be used as:
 - Local Meal Planner. As how I currently use this, Google App Engine is overkill...
 - Show Tracker - To keep track of current TV series that I want to/am watching as too many services!
	- Note: I know this is possible via a variety of apps on the market but they are based on American Show times, rather than UK which doesn't work too well...
